We don't usually start off with an ad, but I'm kind of very excited about this. We got the sponsorship late last night. I am a big fan of the natural world. Bendosus. I love nature. I love to swim. I love pools, but even more importantly, I love lakes and I love oceans. These are things that I am invested in. And I mean, I've never been a hysteric about global warming on either side. Climate change is probably real. Maybe we could do something positive about it. I don't know. But I love swimming. I grew up around the ocean. And I grew up swimming as a kid with my mother. These are the things I'll always remember about my childhood. The smell of saltwater and the sand under your feet running around. I mean, this is... So when we destroy the oceans, we're destroying not only our habitat, or destroying all these great experiences. So we're very happy to kind of... This new project that we're backing right now, and we're trying to involve a lot of our people in it as well. And just a few minutes of it to just kind of tell you what it's about. The weather is very, very important to us. It actually affects every single aspect of our lives. She's right. Before I came to Iceland, I checked the weather. I'm super happy that I did. My umbrella was handy last night. I'm sure it was for many of you. Farmers are... It's essential for farming, when to plant the crops, when to take... And when to harvest the crops. So I'm delighted today for the first time to be able to have the weather channel... Have a look at what's happening for the first time in history, actually, in the high seas. Thank you so much, Gillian. And we've got wonderful new technology here at the Weather Channel. And we are able to deliver a point forecast for the Arctic high seas. And we'll take one location that is north of the northernmost part of Canada, near the Mean Islands. And as you might expect, it's going to be very chilly indeed here. Temperatures will, for the most part, only get up into the negative 20s, Celsius, through the entire week. So you want to take an extra pair of nickers, should you be here any time soon. And we'll take you to another spot on the other side of the Arctic Ocean. And that is north of Russia, northeast of the Anzu Islands. And similarly, it's going to be quite cold. Temperatures in the negative numbers all across the board, right through the end of the week, getting a little bit warmer going into Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Now back to you in Iceland. Thank you. That's clever, because what you did, I don't know who this woman is, but she's trying to get people into supporting the oceans, but she's using things they know like the weather channel. I like this a lot. I don't know she is, but she's got a bright future. Well, today, because that is a first for the Arctic. It is a first for the high seas. And it's a first for the weather channel. So what's this focus on the weather? It's really exciting, of course, that now, for the first time in history, we have the weather for the high seas in the Arctic. That's about 1% of the high seas in total. But what that really means is that almost half the planet, we have no weather for. Think about that for a second. That's crazy. Almost half the planet that we don't have full data for the weather. Jesus, we know it with our friends from the Google. And our friends from the fisheries. Data is key, especially. Data is key, isn't it? Data key. So as exciting that is, I just want to talk a little bit about exploration. Yes. And this is a space exploration budget. I like going away, Playsen. Space exploration budget is about 250 times more than that of our planet. I like what she does here because she's bringing it into space. I might explain some of the reasons for the holes in our ocean exploration. To put this into perspective, on the right hand side, that's a picture of James Cameron going down to the bottom of the ocean at about 36,000 feet. Yeah, fuck yeah. People in the history of our planet have ever gone down to the bottom of the ocean. By contrast, the very good looking chap on the left is our space moonwalker. And we've had 12 people who have walked on the moon. She makes it fun, which I like, because you want to, the environment should be fun. The ocean space. It's very strange because she seems unfocused here a little bit. But her style is to just be in and out. I don't really know what's going on, but I think it's good. But just to put that into perspective for you. It's winning me over. We're mapping the moon to about seven between seven meters and a hundred meters, which is crazy when you think of that. Nice. And also what's odd is that since in the last 40 years, since we've been to the moon, we've brought back about 850 pounds of moon rocks. Again, by contrast, we take out between 100 and about 130 billion worth of fish. Tons of fish a year. Now, the variable, as many of you will know, is because we don't really know what the value is on the illegal fishing department, because boats, as we know, not all boats are tracked. There are about 15% of people. A legal fix, stop it for saying only of people. People have no idea how much your problem illegal fishing is. It's one of the biggest problems in the country. In the world, is illegal fishing, people fishing when they shouldn't without a permit and stuff. So much of it goes on. And it's, I don't know who this woman is, but the fact that she has the guts and the balls to kind of call out the illegal fisherman, to me is huge. Let's let her go for another few minutes. It's the attract, for instance, in the high seas. And just I would like you to think about this for a second. I'd like to know how many of you would like to fly on a plane if only 15% of planes were talking to air traffic control? I don't want to. Or again, perhaps if who'd like to go driving, especially in a private plane, from a little bit more comfortable here in Iceland, if only 15% of the drivers had license plates. No good. We all know. I mean, I'm a bit of a speed demon, so I'd be working through those red lights as long as I knew that no one was traveling. But what that means, or the high seas, no one tracking you, no one goes through the red lights. All those fishing vessels are doing it in any time. Yeah. There are literally hundreds of boats out there that allow them to blow through the boat ships. And it allows them to fish for endangered species because you use a drone and kill them. Chances that they'll be captured. Capture them, that. And so that's a problem because it's putting a lot of pressure on fish. All right. Well, anyway, this is the Terramar project. Is what we're, we've just entered into a partnership with on this show. It's called the Terramar project. I don't know what that means. I think water and land or something. And, and both are very necessary. And this, this woman is fucking bright. And I don't know who she is. But I like, I like the cut of her gym. And I just enjoy it. And so if you like me, think illegal fishing is the best way to do it. Like me, think illegal fishing is the biggest problem in America. And the world, you will get involved with this Terramar project to really kind of fucking go and get those illegal boats. Because we need to know who's fishing. That's the biggest issue. That's the biggest issue on the on the high seas right now on the water. Who's fishing where they shouldn't be fishing? So if there's any way that we can find those people, I think so many other problems are linked into this illegal fishing. It almost seems like illegal fishing is the way that the world is run. You see, there's all these fishermen fishing illegally for fish that they shouldn't have, that they should have thrown back into the water. And one fisherman knows that the other fisherman's doing this with the illegal fish. It doesn't know. And so there's this weird omerta like silence around the idea of illegal fishing. None of the illegal fishermen tell on any of the other illegal fishermen. And nobody has a fucking license. Everybody just says, we're just going out for a fun, you know, a yacht day. But it's not. They're illegally fishing, taking fish they shouldn't have and doing God only knows what to it. On a boat and they all have each other's back. And it's a coat of silence. They spread each other in the black male each other with these illegal fish. And this woman has the balls to call it out. I don't know how we pronounce her name just something. But God bless her and God bless the Terramar project Whitney Webb coming right up. All right, returning favorite Whitney Webb back on the show. She is a writer. Her articles appear at the last American vagabond amongst other publications. She has a Patreon that you should support. We're going to put the link in the description of this episode. And I believe she is in the process of writing a book on the topic that we are going to discuss today. So Whitney Webb, thank you for coming back. You're a fan favorite here. You were tweeting that you don't buy the Jisla in arrest. Or you think it's a little convenient or a little sus, which means suspect as people on the internet say, what about it strikes you as as fishy? All right, where to start? First of all, just before Elaine was arrested, Virginia Roberts attorneys were ordered by a US federal judge to destroy evidence that pertained directly to Gulley Maxwell claiming that they had obtained that evidence illegally. And thus it has to be destroyed. And then they arrest her like the next day. Right? What evidence? It was evidence. Well, it hasn't been made public, right? But they claim that it had been sealed evidence apparently acquired through some sort of FBI stuff that was never made public and never turned into an indictment. Right? And Alan Dershowitz was actually suing to try and get access to that information and was also denied access to it. Right? And so, you know, we're trying to find people that are, you know, representing the victims and people that were associates of abs, you have been denied access to this. But the lawyers who obtained it were trying to use it in court. And they said, no, you can't have this and you have to destroy it. And then Gulley is, you know, arrested a day later in New Hampshire. But, you know, that's just like one thing that preceded this. There's a couple other things that are interesting that preceded this too. And, you know, just to start off, I think it's good to start with just talking about the indictment itself, which I really recommend people that are interested in this case actually take the time to read the indictment against Gulley Maxwell. It's only like 18 pages, so it's not very long. And that for me is the main basis of why I am very suspected what is going on here. What they charge her with, they charge her with, I think it's four counts. One of them is perjury. The other three only relates to enticing minors to travel across state lines for the purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein. But the indictment itself says that Gulley Maxwell was also involved in those sex acts and is basically, you know, basically saying that she sexually assaulted these minors also, but she's not charged for that. She's charged with enticing three girls between 1994 and 1997 to travel across state lines to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, in which she was also involved. And the indictment even says things like it was Gulley and that ordered these girls to take off their clothes and to touch Epstein and that she would also become involved in like, you know, a three-sum or something, but she's not charged with anything related to that. Right, which is just like, yeah, it's not going to admit that and then be like, well, you know, it's fine that you're a pedophile, but you made the travel for it. Right. Right. So why are they not charging her with the actual molestation? You know, that's an interesting, you know, I think that's a very valid point in a question that should be asked of the people, you know, the FBI and the Southern District of New York and, you know, the people responsible for this indictment. Also, as far as her arrest, where is her mug shot? Right. Why hasn't she appeared in federal court yet? She was supposed to be a rain yesterday. There's been no news on that about her having appeared in court. Right. That's not normal. She's just being angry at her mug shot. Right. Now, if she was charged with actually molesting the girls, would that carry a longer sentence? Oh, for sure. And it would also mean that she could be denied bail based on the types of charges she's facing out. It's very likely she'll be allowed to post bail and won't go to prison unless she is sentenced at the conclusion of the trial. Right. So, who knows what could happen by then, whenever that happens, it could be a protracted legal process. They've also set up the narrative that the lanes going to cooperate with authorities, which, you know, when that happens results in a reduced sentence. So it's, I think it's very likely based on the charges she's facing, which are extremely light when you consider the gravity of her crimes. How many children she raped? How many children she recruited for Epstein? And, you know, among numerous other things she was involved in. I mean, because this wasn't just three girls like she was, she's been charged with enticing to travel now. I mean, this network in which the lane was, you know, basically the key, one of the key people, if not the key person, abused thousands of girls. Right. Right. Right. Now, she's arrested. She's taken to where? Where is she? Is she? She's going to the same facility that Jeff was in like where? We don't know. She hasn't appeared in federal court. Well, at the time of us recording this, right? Right. She hasn't been made to appear. There's no mugshot if we're no one really knows that it was just reported that she was arrested. And then they have this press conference. And they didn't show a mugshot or anything. They just showed a picture of, you know, the lane and Jeffrey Epstein together from 2005. And they just talked about how great they are for having arrested her. Even though they apparently have known where she is for a year, because the house she was arrested in a New Hampshire. She bought seven months ago. Right. Now, wasn't there an article that came out a while back that said she was staying in either Massachusetts or New Hampshire. I forget. What was that article? And it was it says she was staying with a guy, right? Somebody who won't. Yeah. His name is Scott Borgison. He's alleged to be her current boyfriend. He runs a company that's a data analytics company for like ocean freight, which is interesting when you consider the lane's recent interest in this whole air alarm project of creating sort of this these independent statelets. I guess you could say in the ocean were international law when it apply. Right. But I mean, in her defense, there's a lot of good people involved in that too, like Bill Glades and the Clintons. Right. Right. Yeah. But anyway, so this guy, right, his company, the main investor in it is Eric Schmidt, the former Google head of Google, right? He's also tied up with the Clintons and all of these fun guys. Yeah. So that's who she was said to have been staying with and what's interesting is after that report came out right after that is when the fake in and out burger picture photo op or whatever in L.A. Came out basically making people think that she was actually on the West Coast, which I guess now in retrospect was a way to divert attention from what was actually happening. What was the point of doing that in an ad photo shoot? I never understood that they photoshopped a movie advertising in the background like it was one of the weirdest pieces of political theater. If you want to say it's political, it was this stunt. What in your estimation was the point of that. Well, I think there's a couple of well, first of all was orchestrated by her attorney and also let's remember the book she was reading the life and death of CIA operatives or something like that and considering the whole intelligence ties of this and also Elaine's face in the picture. I mean, she looks ridiculously smug and she's just sitting there in public. I mean, I think it was honestly sort of a way like, you know, to slap everyone in the face and be like, you know, you can't fuck with me type of deal. I think it was something like that. And you know, I really started this whole trend of media reporting to long delay that treated her like she was Carmen San Diego. Oh, she's, you know, in LA now she's in France. Now she's in England. Now she's in Israel about all the stuff. Where is she? Right. Making no one acting like, you know, implying that she was just traveling all the time. So maybe that's why they couldn't find her. Right. When in fact, she's been in the US the whole time and they've known it and haven't done shit. Right. Why do you think if they waited to arrest her? What do you think that was about? Do you think they were waiting for the conditions to be? Because bar. The attorney general is this is not a person who's interested in getting to the bottom of this case. Right. Right. I mean attorney general Bill bar. His father was the headmaster of Dalton who hired Jeffrey Epstein. So this was also an intelligence bill bar was at the office of strategic services. The precursor to the CIA and at the time he hired Epstein his son Bill bar was working at the CIA. Remember, that's where Bill bars career started. He worked for the CIA. Right. So we have to believe that this attorney general who's been intelligence is entire life whose father is intelligence whose father hired Epstein wants to get to the bottom of this story. Right. Right. Right. Well, I mean, you can also look at Bill bars like past, right. He helped cover up Iran, contrappart and all the Iran, contrappriminals when he was attorney general. The first time under George Bush senior also a CIA director. Right. And helped cover up the promise software scandal in which the Maxwell family was very intimately involved. Right. So like now exactly a person who finds things out. He's more of a guy who covers things up if you look at his track record. He also worked at the law firm. That was, you know, offered that were the defense lawyers for Jeffrey Epstein when he was arrested the first time. So Bill bar was working at the law firm of Jeffrey Epstein's defense attorneys the first time Epstein was arrested. That's correct. Interesting. In what capacity just as an attorney or a consultant or I believe he was an attorney. The law firm is Kirkland and Ellis, I believe. But that's where like his defense lawyers were also part of that firm. But I mean, it's not like bar was part of Epstein's legal team, but he was, you know, in the same law firm as them. Is there any truth to the what's being circulated on Twitter that Bill bar wanted to meet Galein Maxwell, just Lane Maxwell and her attorney denied that or is that just floating around on Twitter? This kind of unsubstantiated. I haven't I haven't heard that so I can't really speak to that, but what's interesting though is that about less than two weeks ago, Bill bar made this big. There was this controversy in this very district. We're talking about right the Southern District of New York or Jeffrey Burman, who was the district attorney when Epstein was indicted last year was basically forced out. And so the person that is currently the district attorney isn't official. They're enacting district attorney and Burman was, you know, just removed from that capacity essentially by Bill bar around 10 or 11 days ago. And then, you know, this other judge, you know, also part of the DOJ technically, right orders this evidence to be destroyed and the Guilin is arrested. Why was Burman forced out? Is there an official story for that? Well, I actually don't really remember the official story because I remember reading it and being like, this is probably bullshit, right? But I think it's worth pointing out that I don't think Jeffrey Burman is a clean guy, right? He used to work for Giuliani, who's like a really shady guy too. And a lot of this stuff, you know, there's just different factions, you know, different, I guess you could say competing like crime families or whatever, you know. So like some of them are dirty, well, they're all really dirty, but they have like, you know, competing interests. But I think it's interesting the timing. And I guess we can speculate as to why it really was, right? Considering what's happened in the days since. I think it's possible, you know, for example, that Bill bar may not have wanted the lane to be arrested at all, for example, because he, you know, as you pointed out, right, has some sort of family tie to this case, right? So it's possible that they didn't want this to move forward at all, even though in my opinion, the charges are complete freaking joke. And are just going to mean that she, you know, gets off light or, you know, probably doesn't go to prison at all. She cooperates or they settle or you know, what? What would be the fact? Sorry. Now what was the version of cooperating? Like what would you do? Yeah, you know, it remains to be seen, right? But basically, you know, even if she does give the information they want on certain people or, you know, things like that. I mean, that's not going to be made public, right? So it's very possible that she enters into some agreement where she cooperates and supposedly gives him information, but none of that is ever made public. They have to decide what to do with the nature of the trial, but it's very unlikely that it would be made public and they could say it's for a separate investigation that's classified and who knows, right?

Now, for people that don't know who Jislene Maxwell is, give us a little background, because you've really done some work on, most people know that her father was a media mogul who had intelligence ties to the Masad, but you've really done a deep dive on the family. Talk a little bit about these fun folks. All right. Well, there are a lot of places we could go with that because it is really extensive. I mean, Robert Maxwell did not just have links or ties to Israeli intelligence. I mean, he was a spy period. Right. He was involved with Israel before it was even founded. He was involved in getting, for example, the Czech Republic to send weapons, designees, paramilitaries before the founding of the state of Israel. So his involvement in airplane parts and things like that's having those smuggled in. He was very involved with that whole, you know, a pre-existence of the state of Israel conflict, right? And that continued well after. I mean, let's remember, too, that Robert Maxwell's funeral was attended by six former and current heads of Israeli intelligence. The person who gave the eulogy was prime minister at the time. It's Haksha Mir, who said Robert Maxwell has done more for Israel than I can say today. And things like that, right? So it's not just like the guy had incidental links to Israel. He was also just involved in a ton of well-known, you know, Israeli espionage activities, including the promise software scandal. I ran Contra, the honey pot entrapment of Israeli nuclear weapons whistleblower Mordeky the new new among numerous others, right? Going to the promise software, just out of curiosity, you've mentioned that before. What was that? So it's kind of a really complex, it's a very complex case, right? But to give like a brief summary, it was basically the software that was developed by the Bill and Nancy Hamilton of Insla Inc. And was, they originally sold it and leased it essentially to the Department of Justice under Reagan in like 1982, at which point the Department of Justice basically through Ed Mies and this other guy that was sort of in the Reagan administration orbit named Earl Bryan, basically made plans with this guy who was in those very famous Israeli intelligence operative named Rafi Aten to essentially steal this software by basically taking it and not paying, making payments to ins law for its use anymore and then adapting it by asserting it back door into that software, which was then sold to governments, intelligence agencies and corporations and banks all over the world. Not just by people like Earl Bryan, who I just mentioned, who made, you know, a company specifically for selling software, but Robert Maxwell had a side tech front company called DeGum that he used to sell that software, not just, you know, throughout the Middle East, but also in the Americas, Central and South America, Robert Maxwell also sold it to sensitive US national laboratories in New Mexico that were used to allow Israel to gain access to that at the time when they were spying heavily on US like scientific and technological research part of which is related to their nuclear weapons program. He also sold it to Russian intelligence to the KGB. So Robert Maxwell was very involved, but also involved were people in the Clinton orbit, including Jackson Stevens company, who was a major, you know, political donor to the Clinton's systematics was the company through which they did that, right, which had Tastor Rose Law firm, which was Hillary Clinton's Law firm at the time had been sposter and all of that. So when you talk about a back door, the intelligent, the software had a back door. The back door would be used to extract information from, yeah, so basically any computer on which the software would install that back door would allow Israeli intelligence access to whatever was on that computer. So this was an act of overt espionage, well covert. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. But I mean, people in the US knew the back door was there because they helped sell it and then you Israel had access to it. So they essentially allowed Israel's intelligence access to computers on sensitive US databases, for example, right, but also in other countries, you know, but I mean, that's kind of treasonous, isn't it? Especially if you're in the Reagan administration. Certainly. Yeah. And Robert Maxwell also was a major media mogul in the UK and he owned, was it six newspapers, I forget. He owned a lot of. Right. He was also a media mogul in Israel and set up newspapers there that still exists today. He also at one point owned the New York Daily News.
